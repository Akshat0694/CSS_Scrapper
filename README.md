# Testrek


This python script is written in Python as part of the project work conducted
at Czech technical University. The main purpose of the project is to automate
the reviewing of student's tests at the Computer Support for Studies examination,
conducted at Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Czech Technical University.

In addition to scrapping the data from the University servers where the students
upload the answers to the test, it also runs a plagiarism check on each file.

The detailed Plan can be found in [here](https://github.com/Akshat0694/Testructor-Lite/blob/master/01_Designs/Akshat_zadaniBP.doc "Original Assignment").
